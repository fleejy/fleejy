I'm Francisco, a knowledge professional based in Canada. I find meaning in making things better or at least not making them worse. Outside of professional work, I enjoy playing strategy board games, listening to music, and acquiring seemingly irrelevant and random skills that evolve to be crucial. You can access my thoughts here.
