- Hiring definition changed.
- Before: Junior, trained to do a job.
- Now: Senior, already know how to do the job.

## What's a good job?
- A place of work that provides you with the opportunity to learn and grow, so that you stay competitive for your next role.
- If the role only does one thing, you'll be stuck doing that one thing for the rest of your career.
- Employee surveys show what people consider to be good benefits: Learning & Development supports.

Platform Team example:
- do you know how to do Infrastructure as Code? Terraform? Great. We use terraform and CDK. You'll learn CDK on the job.
